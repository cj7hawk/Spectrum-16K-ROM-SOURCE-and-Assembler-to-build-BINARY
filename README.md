# Spectrum 16K ROM SOURCE and Assembler to build BINARY
A copy of the Sinclair Spectrum Source for 16K/48K ROM adapted to the Loki Cross Assembler by the Loki Project. Can build the binary - Assembler included. 

I always notice that I find SOURCE on Github but no damn assemblers... And when I do find the assemblers
they don't work on Windows 10/11 and then if they do, I can't find a matching cross-assembler and 
z80 native CP/M based assembler, so I got tired of all of that and wrote my own assembler.

It's not great. I've never written assemblers before.

But it works, it's a Macro assembler, it has cool features, and it's included FREE.

And you can also get the Assembler from the Loki Project.

The Loki Project is a project to complete Sir Clive Sinclair's greatest work - a computer ahead of it's 
time by more than a decade. Hardware 3D and Vector graphics, Synth quality music, 512x192 graphics in 
16 colours. Had it been made in 1985 as was planned, it would have accelerated the computer age and 
catapulted the UK into directly competing with Silicon Valley.

Those of us who grew up in the 80s were offered a chance through Sir Clive's computers to get a head start
on the future. We will never forget it.

Amstrad - thank you - you made the ROM freely available. See the license included.

Here is the SOURCE, confirmed to produce a binary matching output, and an assembler and everything you need
to build and modify the source.
